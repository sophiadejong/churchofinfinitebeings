<h2 class="subtitles" style="padding-top: 2%;">In Praise of Luciferian Technology</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 2%;">This Church was founded in praise of Satan, Lucifer, the Devil, or
whatever you want to call him. I must first make it clear that
I am not here claiming ontological status for the Devil; that
is, I am not claiming that he exists in the sense that you and I
exist. I am quite serious on a symbolic level in what I write
but my statements praising the Devil and attacking Christianity, God, and Jesus are not to be taken as implying the
real existence of any of these supposed beings. The only one
of these that I think one could reasonably believe actually
existed is Jesus. It seems probable that there was a human
being who was a political and religious leader at the time
though it seems to me absurd to believe claims about his
origin or divine nature. My praise of the Devil is not entirely
(though it is mostly) serious, and it is to be taken on a purely
symbolic level. My goal is to bring out the values and perspectives of the Christian tradition and to demonstrate how it
is fundamentally at odds with the values held by myself and
all extropians* and with the perspective we share.<br><br>
<b>A FORCE FOR GOOD</b>
The Devil - Lucifer - is a force for good (where I define
‘good’ simply as that which I value, not wanting to imply any
universal validity or necessity to the orientation). ‘Lucifer’
means ‘light-bringer’ and this should begin to clue us in to
his symbolic importance. The story is that God threw Lucifer
out of heaven because Lucifer had started to question God
and was spreading dissension among the angels. We must
remember that this story is told from the point of view of the
Godists (if I may coin a term) and not from that of the Luciferians (I will use this term to distinguish us from the official Satanists with whom I have fundamental differences).
The truth may just as easily be that Lucifer resigned from
heaven.
God, being the well-documented sadist that he is, no doubt
wanted to keep Lucifer around so that he could punish him
and try to get him back under his (God’s) power. Probably
what really happened was that Lucifer came to hate God’s
kingdom, his sadism, his demand for slavish conformity and
obedience, his psychotic rage at any display of independent
thinking and behaviour. Lucifer realised that he could never
fully think for himself and could certainly not act on his independent thinking so long as he was under God’s control.
Therefore he left Heaven, that terrible spiritual-State ruled by
the cosmic sadist Jehovah, and was accompanied by some of
the angels who had had enough courage to question God’s
authority and his value-perspective.
Lucifer is the embodiment of reason, of intelligence, of critical thought. He stands against the dogma of God and all
other dogmas. He stands for the exploration of new ideas
and new perspectives in the pursuit of truth.
God demands that we believe everything that he tells us, and
that we do everything that he says without questioning. Destroy a tribe including the women, children and animals down
to the last one? (Joshua 6.21) Why of course. Wait a minute,
this doesn’t seem very nice. SILENCE FOOL. HOW DARE
YOU QUESTION ME. I AM GOD AND YOU MUST
OBEY ME WITHOUT QUESTIONING. ACCEPT WHAT I
SAY ON FAITH. BURN THOSE WHO DARE QUESTION
MY WORD. DESTROY THEIR BOOKS. SHUT DOWN
THEIR SCHOOLS. TELL THEM THAT DISOBEDIENCE
MEANS THAT THEY WILL BURN FOREVER AND
EVER, IN UNIMAGINABLE AGONY FOR ALL ETERNITY, AND REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL SUFFER THE
SAME UNLESS YOU GO OUT AND TELL THEM THIS.</p>
