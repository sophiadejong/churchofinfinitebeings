<h2 class="subtitles" style="padding-top: 2%;">In Praise of Luciferian Technology</h2>
<p style="padding-bottom: 2%;">This Church was founded in praise of Satan, Lucifer, the Devil, or
whatever you want to call him. I must first make it clear that
I am not here claiming ontological status for the Devil; that
is, I am not claiming that he exists in the sense that you and I
exist. I am quite serious on a symbolic level in what I write
but my statements praising the Devil and attacking Christianity, God, and Jesus are not to be taken as implying the
real existence of any of these supposed beings. The only one
of these that I think one could reasonably believe actually
existed is Jesus. It seems probable that there was a human
being who was a political and religious leader at the time
though it seems to me absurd to believe claims about his
origin or divine nature. My praise of the Devil is not entirely
(though it is mostly) serious, and it is to be taken on a purely
symbolic level. My goal is to bring out the values and perspectives of the Christian tradition and to demonstrate how it
is fundamentally at odds with the values held by myself and
all extropians* and with the perspective we share.<br><br>
<b>A FORCE FOR GOOD</b>
The Devil - Lucifer - is a force for good (where I define
‘good’ simply as that which I value, not wanting to imply any
universal validity or necessity to the orientation). ‘Lucifer’
means ‘light-bringer’ and this should begin to clue us in to
his symbolic importance. The story is that God threw Lucifer
out of heaven because Lucifer had started to question God
and was spreading dissension among the angels. We must
remember that this story is told from the point of view of the
Godists (if I may coin a term) and not from that of the Luciferians (I will use this term to distinguish us from the official Satanists with whom I have fundamental differences).
The truth may just as easily be that Lucifer resigned from
heaven.
God, being the well-documented sadist that he is, no doubt
wanted to keep Lucifer around so that he could punish him
and try to get him back under his (God’s) power. Probably
what really happened was that Lucifer came to hate God’s
kingdom, his sadism, his demand for slavish conformity and
obedience, his psychotic rage at any display of independent
thinking and behaviour. Lucifer realised that he could never
fully think for himself and could certainly not act on his independent thinking so long as he was under God’s control.
Therefore he left Heaven, that terrible spiritual-State ruled by
the cosmic sadist Jehovah, and was accompanied by some of
the angels who had had enough courage to question God’s
authority and his value-perspective.
Lucifer is the embodiment of reason, of intelligence, of critical thought. He stands against the dogma of God and all
other dogmas. He stands for the exploration of new ideas
and new perspectives in the pursuit of truth.
God demands that we believe everything that he tells us, and
that we do everything that he says without questioning. Destroy a tribe including the women, children and animals down
to the last one? (Joshua 6.21) Why of course. Wait a minute,
this doesn’t seem very nice. SILENCE FOOL. HOW DARE
YOU QUESTION ME. I AM GOD AND YOU MUST
OBEY ME WITHOUT QUESTIONING. ACCEPT WHAT I
SAY ON FAITH. BURN THOSE WHO DARE QUESTION
MY WORD. DESTROY THEIR BOOKS. SHUT DOWN
THEIR SCHOOLS. TELL THEM THAT DISOBEDIENCE
MEANS THAT THEY WILL BURN FOREVER AND
EVER, IN UNIMAGINABLE AGONY FOR ALL ETERNITY, AND REMEMBER THAT YOU WILL SUFFER THE
SAME UNLESS YOU GO OUT AND TELL THEM THIS. <br> Yes sir, God Sir, whatever you say. See, here I am burning
their books, pulling out their nails, torturing them for questioning Church dogma, banning the use of anaesthetic in
child-bearing (since the pain is their just punishment for the
acts of Adam and Eve). Help! I thought an improper
thought! Help me to blind my mind God, help me not to see
what my reason tells me. Let me repress thoughts of sexual
desire, doubts about you and your orders, feelings of tolerance.<br><br>
<b>A FORCE FOR RATIONALITY</b>
They call Lucifer the Prince of Lies. A lie is defined by the
Christian as anything which contradicts the Word of God - as
told to us by the Bible and God’s representatives on Earth. If
we are to accept this definition of a lie then we should praise
lies. A “lie” is then a questioning of blind dogma. The “lies”
of Lucifer are attacks on irrational beliefs, beliefs based on
fear and conformity to authority. Of course we should not
call these lies. They are temptations to think for ourselves, a
call for independent thought, a plea for taking responsibility
for our own thinking and our own lives. Praise Lucifer!
Praise the pursuit of truth through rationality. God was right
to tell us not to worship false idols, but he refrained from
telling us that all idols are false, and that all worship is dangerous. Even our praise of Lucifer must not be worship of an
idol, but rather an expression of our agreement with his
value-orientation and his perspective.
God and his Godists hate Lucifer’s call for rationality. Critical thinking digs at the very roots of God’s and their power
over our minds. Independent thinkers do not make good
slaves. Lucifer is the Prince of Lies because he is an expert
at helping us to be rational. He shows us how to use our
intelligence and how to take responsibility for ourselves. We
should emulate him in encouraging this trend in ourselves
and in others. He needs help since he is working against the
laziness and neuroticism of many humans. It’s so much easier to just not try to think, to sit back and let other people
tell you what you should do, what to believe, and where to
give your money. Why, if I had to think for myself I would
have to face the fact that I might be wrong. Horrors! I
would have to think carefully about my life and the reality
that I live in carefully and that would take a lot of work. No,
it’s much easier to have faith, to accept, to believe, to obey.<br><br>
<b>THE VIRTUE OF PLEASURE</b>
God also hates us to enjoy ourselves. If we let ourselves experience too much pleasure then we might lose interest in
obeying him. We might start running our own lives to bring
us positive rewards rather than directing ourselves to avoid
his wrath. We might become focussed on pursuing the positive instead of avoiding the negative. That would result in
the downfall, of religious and state authority, so God has to
stamp out such tendencies. He hates Lucifer who keeps turning up and tempting us to have a good time, to enjoy our
lives. Adam and Eve’s sin was to eat of the fruit of the tree
of knowledge. They dared to disobey a direct order which
God expected them to obey without question, blindly. They
acquired reason and intelligence to eat of the fruit of the tree
of knowledge. They acquired reason and intelligence, and an
ability to decide for themselves the values that they would
pursue. Ever since then humans have been uppity - always
given God trouble. Dammit, even some of the Catholics are
questioning the Pope’s infallibility. Well that’s just tough,
God; some of us are going to do our best to see that humans
continue to become even more difficult to handle - both by
you and by your human followers on Earth - the religious
authorities and the Statists.<br><br>
<b>THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS</b>
God likes altruism, altruism understood as true self-sacrifice
and not as giving up a minor value to achieve a more important one (which is just one aspect of rationality). If God can
just get us all to be good altruists then we will be so much
easier to control. Altruists do what they are told without
complaint; a complaint would be based in self-interest; it
would be a claim to live one’s own life without having to
direct it towards the lives of others or towards the interests of
God or “the State”. Lucifer perseveres in trying to point out
to us that we have no reason to accept altruism. We can
choose our values for ourselves, just as we can think for ourselves. Lucifer himself values the pursuit of happiness,
knowledge, and new experiences. Most of all he values selfresponsibility and independence even if that means that some
people will not choose to value the things that he values. The
extropians among us who share his perspectives and valueorientation should help him in his work.
God has a clever and nasty strategy to promote altruism and
therefore obedience. He tries to get us to believe in Original
Sin. He wants us to believe that we are born sinful, that we
were evil and needed saving even before we had done anything. We need God and his agents to save us from Sin
otherwise we will burn FOREVER and we will miss out on
an infinite and perfect reward (though he never tells us just
what this is). Our path to salvation lies in service to God and
his dogma. Without the idea of Original Sin we might not be
so careful to obey God since we might figure that we were
living pretty well and would go to heaven anyway (foolishly
failing to inquire what heaven is like). Fortunately for God,
Original Sin guarantees that we will always feel under threat.
We will always be unclean and in danger of suffering hellfire.<br><br>
<b>PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY</b>
To make quite sure that our personal responsibility is destroyed, and that we put ourselves in God’s hands for him to
mould us as he wishes, God and his moronic minions repeatedly tell us that Jesus Christ is the Way and that he died
for our sins. Redemption lies through faith and obedience.
Notice what happens when Christ supposedly died for our
sins. His act brought about our possibility of salvation.
What I want to know is: how can someone else’s act excuse
me from anything? I am responsible for my own actions.
Nothing that I do can take away the fact that someone else is
acting in a certain way, and nothing that they can do can
absolve me of my own responsibility. Original Sin and salvation by Christ are both deeply offensive ideas to me and to all
extropians who value individual responsibility.
In ending this discussion, I want to remind you that you are
all Popes. You are all your own highest authority. You are
the source of your action. You choose your values - whether
you do so actively or by default. You choose what to believe,
how strongly to believe, and what you will take as disconfirming evidence. No one has authority over you - you are
your own authority, your own value-chooser, your own thinker. Join me, join Lucifer, and join Extropy in fighting God
and his entropic forces with out minds, our wills and our
courage. God’s army is strong, but they are backed by ignorance, fear and cowardice. Reality is fundamentally on our
side. Forward into the light!</p>

<h2 class="subtitles" style="padding-top: 2%;">The 11 Luciferian Transhumanist Points of Power</h2>
	
<p style="padding-bottom: 2%;"> 1. Lucifer represents the light of intellect, wisdom and power unique to each individual with the courage to ascend to this responsibility.<br>

2. The symbol of the Adversary is that of the self-liberator and spiritual rebel who inspires self-evolution.<br>

3. Lucifer represents the balanced torch bearer of Venus: the Light Bringer as the Morning Star and the Night Bringer as the Evening Star.<br>

4. The Adversary symbolizes the spark of consciousness which questions everything, manifesting the individualistic path with accountability only to the self.<br>

5. The fall of Lucifer or Satan symbolizes the liberation of the mind from the slave-mentality and the courage to explore and master the darkness within. One may not offer the illumination of the Morning Star without the wisdom of the darkness within.<br>

6. The Adversary represents rebellion with purpose: wisdom, strength and power.<br>

7. Lucifer represents the courage and fortitude to acquire healthy self-love, leading to the responsibility of honoring your temple of mind, body and spirit.<br>

8. To become your own god you must have the wisdom and strength to govern and guide your life as if your mind is to survive beyond the mortal body.<br>

9. Indulgence with restraint, love for the deserving and disdain for those undeserving.<br>

10. Lucifer represents the insight that every act, no matter if perceived as selfless, is at core a selfish act. Even if helping others is your passion, the brain still receives a chemical reward triggered by the act. This is why many consider that doing good deeds in society may bring you closer to “god”. Recognize you are selfish, then see this fact in all others while observing. Accept this and then with this knowledge, make choices that would benefit not only yourself but your loved ones’ when possible.<br>

11. To become a god is to fully understand that you possess the power to create and sustain your path in life and illuminate the light of self-determined potential.</p>
